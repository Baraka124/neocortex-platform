# Welcome to My Digital Garden 🌱

This is where I share ideas, thoughts, and knowledge. Everything you see here comes from a single markdown file that automatically updates this website.

## About This Platform

**MarkStream** is a revolutionary approach to personal publishing:
- **One file** - All content in `content.md`
- **Automatic updates** - Edit markdown → site updates instantly
- **Zero maintenance** - No databases, no build process
- **Beautiful design** - Clean, responsive, dark/light mode

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Write** - Add content in markdown format
2. **Separate** - Use `---` between sections
3. **Tag** - Add tags for organization
4. **Publish** - Commit to GitHub, that's it!

# The Future of Web Development 🚀

The web is evolving faster than ever. Here are my predictions for the next 5 years:

## 1. AI-First Development

```javascript
// Instead of writing code manually
const app = ai.generateApp({
  description: "A markdown-based content platform",
  features: ["auto-update", "responsive", "zero-config"]
});

// AI writes the code for us
