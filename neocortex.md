# Why Simple Wins

We've overcomplicated the web. Let's fix that.

## The Problem
Modern web development has become:
- Framework churn every 6 months
- 100MB node_modules for "Hello World"
- Build processes that take minutes
- Deployments that need CI/CD pipelines

## The Solution
**Go back to basics:**
1. HTML
2. CSS  
3. JavaScript
4. Markdown

That's it.

## This Platform's Stack
```javascript
const stack = {
  frontend: "Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS",
  hosting: "GitHub Pages (free)",
  content: "Single markdown file",
  updates: "Instant via GitHub API",
  cost: "$0/month",
  maintenance: "0 minutes/week"
};
Does it work?????
