# Welcome to My Neocortex 🧠

This is my personal thinking space where I share ideas, projects, and reflections. Everything updates automatically when I edit this single markdown file.

## What This Is
- **Digital Brain** - My thoughts organized and searchable
- **Auto-updating Platform** - Edit markdown → instant website update
- **Zero Maintenance** - No servers, no databases, no build process
- **Open Source** - Anyone can see how it works

## How It Works
1. I write in this markdown file
2. GitHub hosts it for free
3. The site reads this file and renders it beautifully
4. That's it!

# Rethinking Personal Websites

Why do personal websites need to be complex? They don't.

## The Revolution
What if your entire website was just:
- 1 HTML file (the renderer)
- 1 Markdown file (your content)
- 0 databases
- 0 build steps
- 0 maintenance

## Benefits
- **Instant Updates** - Edit and publish in seconds
- **No Technical Debt** - Simple is sustainable
- **Future Proof** - Markdown will outlive any framework
- **Accessible** - Works everywhere, for everyone

## My Vision
> "The most powerful tools are often the simplest."

This platform proves that complexity isn't necessary for a beautiful, functional personal website.

# My Technology Philosophy

## Core Principles

### 1. Simplicity First
> "Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex... It takes a touch of genius to move in the opposite direction." - E.F. Schumacher

### 2. Human-Centric Design
Technology should serve people, not the other way around.

### 3. Open by Default
Transparency builds trust and enables collaboration.

### 4. Sustainable Systems
Build things that last, not things that need constant maintenance.

## Technology Stack Philosophy

### For Personal Use
- **Markdown** for notes and content
- **Plain text** where possible
- **Local-first** applications
- **Open formats** for everything

### For Development
- **Vanilla** over frameworks when possible
- **Progressive enhancement**
- **Accessibility** as a requirement
- **Performance** as a feature

### For Infrastructure
- **Static** over dynamic when possible
- **Serverless** for scalability
- **Edge computing** for speed
- **Git** for version control
